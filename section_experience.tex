    {May2018}      {
                    One of three projects of my dissertation:
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Working with NOAAâ€™s Atmospheric Turbulence Diffusion Division (ATDD) to quantify \ce{CH4} emissions at soil-, stem-, canopy-atmosphere interfaces                        
                        \item Deployed CRDS (Picarro G2201-i) coupled to an autochamber (eosAC) and a homemade sleeve for soil- and stem-gas measurements, respectively
                        \item Plan to collect 6+ months (tens of GBs) of measurements               
                        \item Applying time-series \& signal processing analysis (wavelet \& spectral analysis)     
                      \end{itemize}

    {Jul2017}      {
                    Two of three projects of my dissertation:
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Developed mobile laboratory using cavity ring-down spectroscopic technology to measure \ce{CH4} \& \ce{CO2} and carbon isotopes
                        \item Investigated spatial and temporal trends of gas emissions at both calderas to compare and contrast the two supervolcanoes      
                        \item Designed project to gather first measurements of diffuse \ce{CH4} emissions in N. American calderas 
                        \item Constructed an algorithm to model the sampling of soil gas emissions with linear programming and Monte Carlo simulation
                        \item Devised algorithms to quantify hundreds of flux and isotopic measurements at dozens of locations between both calderas
                        \item Recorded emissions prior, during, after geyser eruptions (including tallest active geyser, Steamboat)
                        \item Corresponded with hundreds of patrons during data collection
                      \end{itemize}

                     \begin{itemize}
                        \item Established methodology for spectroscopic-chamber (Picarro G2201-i \& eosAC) measurements at several hydraulic fracturing sites 
                        \item Sought to detect thermogenic \ce{CH4} from leaking natural gas wells with surface flux measurements and carbon isotope measurements
                        \item Fabricated static chambers to sample heavier hydrocarbons; processed samples with gas chromatograph
