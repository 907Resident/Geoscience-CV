                    One of three projects of my dissertation:
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Working with NOAA’s Atmospheric Turbulence Diffusion Division (ATDD) to quantify \ce{CH4} emissions at soil-, stem-, canopy-atmosphere interfaces                        
                        \item Deployed CRDS (Picarro G2201-i) coupled to an autochamber (eosAC) and a homemade sleeve for soil- and stem-gas measurements, respectively
                        \item Plan to collect 6+ months (tens of GBs) of measurements               
                        \item Applying time-series \& signal processing analysis (wavelet \& spectral analysis)     
                      \end{itemize}

    {Jul2017}      {
                    Two of three projects of my dissertation:
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Developed mobile laboratory using cavity ring-down spectroscopic technology to measure \ce{CH4} \& \ce{CO2} and carbon isotopes
                        \item Examined spatial and temporal trends of gas emissions at both calderas to compare and contrast the two supervolcanoes      
                        \item Designed project to gather first measurements of diffuse \ce{CH4} emissions in N. American calderas 
                        \item Evolutions et corrections des bugs du framework de développement interne                
                        \item Devised algorithms to quantify hundreds of flux and isotopic measurements at dozens of locations between both calderas
                        \item Recorded emissions prior, during, after geyser eruptions (including tallest active geyser, Steamboat)
                      \end{itemize}

  {Oct2015}       {
                   Master's Thesis, Completed in 2016:
                     \begin{itemize}
                        \item Established methodology for spectroscopic-chamber (Picarro G2201-i \& eosAC) measurements at several hydraulic fracturing sites 
                        \item Sought to uncover whether thermogenic \ce{CH4} from leaking \ce{CH4} wells could be detected from surface flux measurements and carbon isotope measurements
                        \item Fabricated static chambers and transported gases to the lab for measurements with gas chromatograph           
                        \item Final products include data reduction algorithms and a manuscript

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Traveled above the Arctic Circle to the tundra as a team member of a multi-institution NASA funded project      
                        \item Sought to answer how the warming climate affects physiological processes of increasingly abundant deciduous shrubs through studying the exchange of \ce{CO2} between the atmosphere and the shrubs            
                        \item Drafted and constructed homemade chamber in the lab and deployed the chamber and infrared gas analyzer in the field
