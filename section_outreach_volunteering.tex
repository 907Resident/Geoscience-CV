    {May 2018}      {
                    One of three projects of my dissertation:
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Working with NOAAâ€™s Atmospheric Turbulence Diffusion Division (ATDD) to quantify \ce{CH4} emissions at soil-, stem-, canopy-atmosphere interfaces                        
                        \item Deployed CRDS (Picarro G2201-i) coupled to an autochamber (eosAC) and a homemade sleeve for soil- and stem-gas measurements, respectively
                        \item Plan to collect 6+ months (tens of GBs) of measurements               
                        \item Applying time-series \& signal processing analysis (wavelet \& spectral analysis)     
                      \end{itemize}

	{Jul 2016}	{                
	                \begin{itemize}
	                \item Over 7 days, graduate students and post-doctoral associate learned in the field and in the classroom about the complex nature and processes of deep carbon that are manifested at the surface of Yellowstone
	                \item Forged a connection with colleagues at Univ. of New Mexico, which turned into research for dissertation
